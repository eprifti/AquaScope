## Why AquaScope?

Aquarium keeping is incredibly rewarding — but it's also an expensive hobby. Between tanks, livestock, equipment, tests, and consumables, costs add up fast. When I looked for tools to log parameters and track long-term trends, the options were disappointing: paid subscriptions, locked "pro" features, closed ecosystems, or abandoned projects.

As a developer and aquarist, I decided to build what I couldn't find.

**The philosophy is simple:**

- **Free forever** — no subscriptions, no paid tiers
- **Fully open-source** — transparent, hackable, auditable
- **Your data stays yours** — self-hosted, no cloud dependency
- **Built by an aquarist, for aquarists** — from reef to freshwater to brackish
- **Modular & extensible** — adapt it to DIY monitoring, sensors, or research

> The hobby is already costly enough — logging and understanding your aquarium shouldn't be.

  <br />
  <em>Freshwater &bull; Saltwater &bull; Brackish — all ecosystems, one tool</em>
</p>

AquaScope will remain open and free. Pull requests, issues, ideas, and discussions are always welcome.

## Landing Page

A standalone promotional page is available in the [`landing/`](landing/) directory. Open `landing/index.html` in any browser — no build step required. It features a dark aquarium theme with animated bubbles, caustics overlays, feature showcases, and interactive screenshot tabs. Use it to present AquaScope to the community or host it on your own domain.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eprifti/AquaScope.git
cd AquaScope
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and update the following critical values:

```env
# Change these for security
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
INFLUXDB_ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secure-token
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-jwt
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start all services:
- Frontend: http://localhost
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- InfluxDB UI: http://localhost:8086
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- **AquaScope UI**: http://localhost
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **InfluxDB UI**: http://localhost:8086

### 5. Initial Setup

1. Register a new user account at http://localhost/register
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Create your first tank
4. Start logging parameters!

### 6. Load Demo Data (Optional)

Seed the database with two fully configured aquariums (saltwater SPS reef + freshwater Amazonian biotope) including livestock, equipment, maintenance schedules, notes, and months of parameter history:

```bash
bash scripts/seed_demo.sh
```

Then log in with:
- **Email**: `demo@reeflab.io`
- **Password**: `demo1234`

---

## Backup & Restore

### Create a Backup

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh [output_directory]
```

Creates a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive containing PostgreSQL dump, InfluxDB backup, and all uploaded files with a manifest.

### Restore from Backup

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh <backup_file.tar.gz>
```

Restores all data from a backup archive with interactive confirmation.

---

## Grafana Integration

### Configure Grafana Datasource

1. In Grafana, add a new InfluxDB datasource
2. Configure the connection:
   - **URL**: `http://influxdb:8086` (if Grafana is in the same Docker network) or `http://localhost:8086`
   - **Organization**: `reeflab` (or value from `INFLUXDB_ORG`)
   - **Token**: Use the value from `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_TOKEN` in your `.env`
   - **Default Bucket**: `reef_parameters` (or value from `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`)

3. Test and save the datasource

### Query Parameters

Your parameter data is stored in InfluxDB with the following structure:

- **Measurement**: `reef_parameters`
- **Tags**:
  - `user_id`: User identifier
  - `tank_id`: Tank identifier
  - `parameter_type`: Type of parameter (calcium, magnesium, alkalinity_kh, nitrate, phosphate, salinity, temperature, ph)
- **Field**: `value` (float)

Example Flux query:

```flux
from(bucket: "reef_parameters")
  |> range(start: -30d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "reef_parameters")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["parameter_type"] == "calcium")
```

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 with hot-reload enabled.

### Testing

AquaScope includes comprehensive unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend.

**Backend Tests (Pytest)**:
```bash
cd backend
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest -m unit           # Run only unit tests
pytest -m integration    # Run only integration tests
pytest --cov=app         # Run with coverage report
```

**Frontend Tests (Vitest)**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:ui         # Run with interactive UI
npm run test:coverage   # Run with coverage report
```

### Continuous Integration

AquaScope uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality assurance. Every push and pull request triggers:

1. **Backend Tests**: Pytest suite with PostgreSQL service container
2. **Frontend Tests**: TypeScript type checking and Vite build verification
3. **Docker Build**: Validates that both frontend and backend Docker images build successfully

The CI pipeline ensures code quality and prevents regressions. View the [workflow file](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for details.

### Database Migrations

Create a new migration:

```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

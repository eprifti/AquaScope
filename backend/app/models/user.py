"""
User Model

Represents authenticated users in the system. This is the core entity for multi-tenancy,
ensuring each user has isolated access to their own reef data.

Design Decisions:
- UUID primary key: Provides better security and prevents enumeration attacks
- Email as unique identifier: Standard practice for authentication
- Hashed password: Never store plain text passwords
- Timestamps: Track account creation and updates for auditing

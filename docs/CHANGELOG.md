### Fixed
- **Image Loading Issues**: Resolved photos and tank images not displaying
  - Root cause: Direct file path access vs. API blob URL fetching
  - Implemented blob URL pattern for all images:
    - Photos: `photosApi.getFileBlobUrl(photoId, thumbnail)`
    - Tank images: `tanksApi.getImageBlobUrl(tankId)`
  - Added proper cleanup in useEffect returns

  - Fixed `tankId` unused in `TankOverview` and `TankTabs`
  - Updated prop interfaces to remove unnecessary parameters
  - Clean TypeScript compilation with no errors

### Technical
- **Routing**: Nested routes structure for tank details
  - `/tanks` - Tank list
  - `/tanks/:tankId` - Individual tank detail page
  - Uses React Router `<Outlet />` for nested rendering

- **API Client Additions**:
  - `tanksApi.uploadImage(tankId, file)` - FormData upload
  - `tanksApi.getImageBlobUrl(tankId)` - Blob URL fetch
  - `tanksApi.listEvents(tankId)` - Tank events
  - `tanksApi.createEvent/updateEvent/deleteEvent` - Event CRUD

- **Component Architecture**:
  - Split-view pattern (sidebar + tabbed content) from ICPTests
  - Reusable modal patterns for uploads and forms
  - Consistent loading and empty states across components

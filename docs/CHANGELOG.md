## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

#### Water Change Calculator

- **Profile persistence**: replacement water values saved to localStorage
- **Quick action** button in TankSidebar for direct access with tank pre-selection
- Fully translated into 6 languages ([docs](docs/water-change-calculator.md))

#### Dark Mode

#### Dosing Calculator
- **Chemistry-based Ca/KH/Mg corrections** with product-specific dosing amounts
- `DosingCalculator` component with interactive input form
- Landing page section showcasing the calculator

#### Livestock Compatibility Checker
- **8-rule compatibility engine** detecting aggression, reef-safety, predator-prey, tank-size, territorial, size-disparity, water-type, and species-specific conflicts
- **60+ species knowledge base** (`data/species-traits.json`) with genus-level matching across saltwater fish, corals, invertebrates, and freshwater species
- **Heatmap matrix visualization** — asymmetric CSS grid showing pairwise compatibility with color-coded cells (green/amber/red), click-to-inspect details, directional aggressor/victim axes
- **Network graph visualization** — force-directed SVG layout with directed edges (red solid = predator-prey, red dashed = incompatible, amber dashed = caution), category-colored nodes, hover highlighting
- **Inline compatibility alert** in livestock form — real-time check when adding new species to a tank
- **3-tab modal** (Issues / Matrix / Network) accessible from the Livestock page
- **Species traits admin CRUD** — Admin > Species tab with search, filters, inline add/edit form, and REST API at `/api/v1/species-traits`
- **Water type validation** — backend enforces livestock water type matches tank water type

#### Livestock Species Typeahead
- **Debounced typeahead search** on the species name field — type 3+ characters to auto-search WoRMS, iNaturalist, or FishBase
- Species lookup works in both **create and edit** mode — correct a misidentified species by simply editing the name
- Compact source tabs (WoRMS / iNaturalist / FishBase) below the species name input
- Selecting a result auto-fills photo, taxonomy, and external IDs; clears stale IDs from previous sources

#### Dashboard Enhancements
